- definition of application, module and release? Service?

Module: - Bunch of functions grouped in a single file under a single name

Application: - the way you package related modules in Erlang. Unit of functionality.

Release: - A release consists of a set of applications together with some metadata specifying how to start and manage those applications as a system.
         A release contains a stripped down Erlang runtime just for the applications included.
