## Simple Cache

This is the simple_cache application from the superb book
[Erlang and OTP in Action](http://www.manning.com/logan/). The full source code
for the book is
[here](https://github.com/erlware/Erlang-and-OTP-in-Action-Source).

All I've done is reformat the code so I can build it with
[rebar](https://bitbucket.org/basho/rebar/wiki/GettingStarted). Credit goes to
the original authors and all mistakes are my own.
